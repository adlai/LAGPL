;;;; The completed text of the software licence must be executable
;;;; as a Common Lisp program, as standardized by ANSI X3J13, with
;;;; preference given to subsequent standards that require signals
;;;; of the CL:SIMPLE-WARNING type to be raised both when the code
;;;; references deprecated symbols for any purpose whatsoever, ...

;;;; THE PURPOSE for which LAGP must expose this licence is:
;;;;
;;;;   Reduce the net worth floor for Accredited Investors,
;;;;   preferably without compromising upon LAGP's PURPOSE.
;;;;
;;;; END PURPOSE

;;;; If you are concerned about the legal uncertainty imposed by
;;;; the contents of this file, please ask your lawyer to recom-
;;;; -mend both a medication, and both a licenced psychiatrist,
;;;; and a dealer in generic pharmaceuticals, such as ethanol,
;;;; nitrous oxide, diethyl ether, and ocean waves cresting.

;;; As an experiment, I will respond here as though the disabling of
;;; quote-and-reply has been enacted; and since this will have been my
;;; first post in the forum, it will contain more than a fair share of
;;; my own history.
;;;
;;; Several times in the above conversation, distaste was expressed
;;; about a twist taken by the author of the article under discussion:
;;; that of introducing distributed ledgers as an eleventh-hour
;;; samaritan for the free software community. Although I personally
;;; share in the skepticism about that viewpoint, my own perspective
;;; is possibly quite different from that of the above posters: I have
;;; most of my (rather embarassing) net worth in one currency, and
;;; let's just say that it's not one managed by a registered
;;; foundation; however, the past decade has done almost nothing other
;;; than teach me, by example, about the problems that emerge when
;;; technologies are heaped skywards without consideration of
;;; fundamental principles, a situation quite reminiscent of that
;;; fable, The Tower of Babylon.
;;;
;;; You may wonder why anyone, who claims a decade of experience with
;;; the latest tech bubble, still cares about software licensing; and
;;; in my case, the probable answer of programming being fun is sadly
;;; incorrect. Maybe programming could be fun, in an enlightened world
;;; where the Zeroth Law of Robotics took precedent over the fashion
;;; to glamorise disruption, yet that is not the world in which I
;;; program, and possibly not yours, either. I only arrived at this
;;; forum due to having recently begun a search for a license more
;;; appropriate for my own project; to the great consternation of the
;;; copyleft advocates, a chore that rapidly ceased to be a selection
;;; from an endless menu of existing texts, and became a blank file,
;;; waiting for my own words.
